ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps infrastructure automation and delivery workflow by integrating IaC, Configuration Management, CI/CD, and GitOps.

ðŸ”¹ Key Components

Terraform â†’ Used as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision AWS cloud resources such as VPC, subnets, networking components, and an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster.

AWS EKS (Kubernetes) â†’ Provides a scalable, managed Kubernetes platform to orchestrate containerized applications.

Helm â†’ Package manager for Kubernetes to simplify application deployment using charts.

ArgoCD (GitOps) â†’ Manages application deployments in EKS by continuously syncing the Git repository state with the cluster.

Ansible â†’ Handles configuration management tasks such as installing required packages, system updates, and dependency setup across worker nodes or supporting servers.

Jenkins (CI/CD) â†’ Automates the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline, integrating with Git, building container images, pushing them to a registry, and deploying them into EKS via Helm and ArgoCD.
